        possibilities of software engineering, my passion lies in crafting
        applications that solves real-world problems and designing architectures
        that stand the test of time. When I'm not coding, you can find me
        tinkering with new tech, exploring the latest design patterns, or
        sipping a cup of coffee. Weather it's a cup of coffee or a full-stack
        web application I prefer to make it from scratch as much as possible.
        Don't get me wrong I know that it's not a great idea to build from
        scratch everytime, but it's something I've always prefered to do as it
        gives a unique touch to my work. Using the latest tools and technologies
        like tailwind CSS, Next JS makes it easy as I can build reusable custom
        components fast and efficiently. This site is not completed yet. I'm
        working on it, consistently adding new features everyday and improving
        it. So if you have any suggestions or ideas, please don't hesitate to
        reach out and visit regularly to see what's new. I am always open to
        discuss new projects, creative ideas or opportunities to be part of your
        visions. Let's connect and create something together. */}
